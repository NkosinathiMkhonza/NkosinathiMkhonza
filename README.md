# Hi, I'm Nkosinathi 👋

I'm a junior software developer in training, focused on building strong foundations
in programming, Git, and problem-solving through hands-on projects.

I’m currently transitioning into tech from a non-technical role and working
consistently to build real, practical software projects.

## 🚀 What I'm working on
- Building Python-based applications from scratch
- Strengthening my Git & GitHub workflow
- Learning how to design simple, useful software solutions

## 🧰 Tech Stack (learning & using)
As part of HyperionDev’s Software Engineering bootcamp, I’m developing skills in:

**Core / Backend**
- Python
- SQL
- Git & GitHub
- Core computer science fundamentals

**Web & Full-Stack (progressively learning)**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Flask (Python web framework)
- Node.js (introductory exposure)

**Tooling & Practices (exposure through projects)**
- Command Line (Windows / PowerShell)
- Basic project structuring and version control workflows

## 📌 Projects
- **Git Task** – Demonstrates core Git concepts such as initialization, staging,
  committing, and pushing to GitHub  
- **Example Repo** – Contains practice code and a structured README to document learning progress  

(More projects coming soon as I continue building.)

## 🎯 Goal
My goal is to transition into a junior software development role by consistently
building real projects and improving my technical skills.
